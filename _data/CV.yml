The load required by electric vehicles was characterized using statistical information and Monte Carlo Simulation analysis - Feasibility, operation and contingency studies: Power flow simulation was carried out on the IEEE 14-bar transmission network. It was verified that the unregulated charging of electric vehicles generates in the network a need for additional charging than what the system can offer for some output scenarios of Monte Carlo Simulation. The contingency evaluation variables "Not Served Power" & "Not Served Energy" were used to quantify the amount of additional energy required by electric vehicles in the scenarios that are required. Two ways of supplying the additional energy required by electric vehicles were tested, through the use of a constant energy source during the day and through solar generation with energy storage in batteries. Both systems were dimensioned achieving an optimal power flow without the presence of Not Served Power, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model used to carry out the work of centralized management for electric vehicles with deregulated charging.'

    Condition: ' Project Management: In charge of Mr. Eng. Manfred Bedri�ana Arones. - Data and business analysis: Analysis and management of SEIN databases, system failures, transmission projects. Investment perspective in transmission lines to enable greater renewable generation capacity. Perspective of reduction of technical losses in electricity distribution companies. - Feasibility, operation and contingency studies: Analysis of alternative solutions to optimize power flows. Evaluation of the particle swarm model and the Newton Rhapson method, it was verified that the use of two solvers in series to solve an optimization problem consumes a lot of computing power. The contingency analysis N-1 adjacent to the generation bars with renewable energies was considered. The expansion of renewable generation was considered as a reinforcement in the bars that currently have this technology.'

    Condition: ' Project Management: Worked in coordination with Scrum & Prince2 under the direction of MBA Jorge Juscamayta Meza and Eng. Fernando Fernandez Valeriano. - Data and business analysis: The analysis of the company''s meter database was carried out at the transmission level and free customers in the concession area, as well as the preparation of executive reports and KPIs on the state of the company in national comparison. In addition, reports were reported with regulatory agents and perspectives on predictive maintenance and risks in transmission equipment were carried out. The company''s technical losses were also calculated and insights were developed to reduce them. - Feasibility, operation and contingency studies: ION meter programming and monitoring, operability and contingency studies, alarm programming for circulating current in substation transformers, preparation of load projections for predictive maintenance monitoring, maintenance and calibration of ION meters in transmission substation installations and maintenance of the meter integration framework.'
